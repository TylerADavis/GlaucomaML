DDLSNet Project

Tool to grade optic nerve head fundus images for disc damagelihood scale. DDLSNet takes the RDR and ARW values from RimNet, 
combines them with a disc size category generated by a classification model (DiscNet), and calculates DDLS.

Running

Due to the way the repo is structured, if you wish to directly invoke a script that imports anything, you need to do python3 -m models.disc_size_model. See this Stack Overflow post.

This project requires TensorFlow >= 2.6.0.
