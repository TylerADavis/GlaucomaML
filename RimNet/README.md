Tool to segment color optic nerve head fundus photos into rim, cup, and background classes.

## Running

Due to the way the repo is structured, if you wish to directly invoke a script
that imports anything, you need to do `python3 -m models.visualize_train.py`. See this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14132912/).

This project requires TensorFlow >= 2.6.0.
